# Sports-News-Schedule_App

This application was written to mimic the Google Now application as an exercise attempt to pull data from an api source.
A callback was used to pull json data from a server, which was then parsed using the Retrofit library. Data was displayed 
into a Recycler View which can extend into a fragment when clicked.
